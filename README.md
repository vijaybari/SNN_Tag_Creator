# Summary:
# This script manages the creation and copying of folders within a Subversion (SVN) repository based on XML configurations.
# It allows the user to select a configuration, parses the associated XML file, creates a tag in SVN, 
# and copies the specified folders to that tag.

# This will be helpful to create tags out of mutiple commits in a same svn repo based on revision we can create different folders.
